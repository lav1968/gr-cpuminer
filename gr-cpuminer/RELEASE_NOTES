Security warning
----------------

Miner programs are often flagged as malware by antivirus programs. This is
usually a false positive, they are flagged simply because they are
cryptocurrency miners. However, some malware masquerading as a miner has
been spread using the cover that miners are known to be subject to false
positives ans users will dismiss the AV alert. Always be on alert.
The source code of cpuminer-opt is open for anyone to inspect.
If you don't trust the software don't download it.

The cryptographic hashing code has been taken from trusted sources but has been
modified for speed at the expense of accepted security practices. This
code should not be imported into applications where secure cryptography is
required.

Compile Instructions
--------------------

See INSTALL_LINUX or INSTALL_WINDOWS for compile instruuctions

Requirements

Change Log
----------

1.2.3

#### General Changes:
- Disable new rplant protocol by default. Can be enabled with `--confirm-block`
  Please do not use the flag until rplant fixes their pool.
  rplant is not counting skipped shares on their backend
  towards the users which leads to lower miner payouts/hashrate on the pool.
- Minor output changes.
- Remove some sleeps on Windows release as help and benchmark.log are now
  available for users.
- Add info if the user is trying to use SSL protocol for non-SSL stratum when
  miner is not able to connect to the pool's stratum.
- Warn users if they are possibly using not optimal binaries.
- Make sure Windows .bat file starts proper binaries after the miner crash.
- Build-in stress test.
  This should provide users with good stress test for their CPU in case
  they want to check basic system stability. Running it for 10 minutes minimum
  should provide basic stability validation. Longer runs are recommended but not
  necessary.

#### Flags:
- Add `--temp-sensor=PATH` - Specify temperature readout file/sensor.
- Add `--stress-test`      - Stress test CPU with 2 fastest rotations.
- Add `--confirm-block` - Enable miner to send more data if a share is solving
  the block.


1.2.2

#### Fix:
- Fix problem (introduced in 1.2.1) while staying at one of the dev pools
  even after the donation period finishes.
  **! Affected only pool. Users were still mining to their wallets !**
  It could occur while having connection problems during the donation period
  was still ongoing and during longer connection problems in general.


1.2.1

#### Windows Fixes:
- **Fix crashing problem on Windows.**
- Fix affinity not allocating threads to selected hardware threads

#### Linux Fixes:
- Fix affinity only allowing for up to 64 threads if set in any way.

#### Automation Scripts:
- Added 2 CPU models on windows binaries. (Please contact me on RTM discord if
  it detects wrong binaries for you)
- Users can now override and select specific binary:
-- by modifying lines 6 & 9 of the cpuminer.bat (Windows)
-- by adding miner suffix as argument like `./cpuminer.sh avx2` for AVX2 binaries. (Linux)

#### General Changes:
- Autodetect GCC for build.sh


1.2.0

#### Windows Fixes:
- Fix MSR setup.
- Properly close/stop WinRing0 driver after closing the miner.
- Fix problems with stratum switching while using SSL stratum.
- Compiled binaries should now properly handle multi NUMA configurations.
- Disable QuickEdit on Windows. Prevents user from accidentally freezing the miner.

#### General Fixes:
- Fix inaccurate Average hashrate counter that was displayed above each "Periodic Report".
- Fix the problem of "Low difficulty share" in situations where the new block 
  is found almost instantly.
- Add Large Pages to different NUMA nodes if some have 0 or not enough memory (Linux).
- Minor fixes.

#### General Changes:
- Linux binaries system main requirements: libssl-1.1, libcurl-4, glibc-2.16.
- Added autodetect script to the linux and Windows binary packages.
  They should start the best possible binary for the CPU used by the user.
- Added default `config.json` file that is used to provide flags in one simple place.
- Benchmark provides even more accurate results and takes into consideration
  sub rotations.
- Doing benchmark of the miner now creates `benchmark.log` file with results.
- Automatically add lost shares to a new entry in "Periodic Report" 
  instead of displaying a warning about share mismatch.
- Remove some unused debug output.
- Show progress of the tuning process in percent as well as 
  tests_done / tests_total and estimate of time remaining.
- Pass benchmark and tuning speed to the API.
- Provide info about the rotation of the current block and a rough speed estimate.

#### Algorithm Improvements:
- General optimizations for GhostRider (~0-2% increase).
- New tuning process (up to 15% increase, most noticeable on Intel and Zen/Zen+ CPUs):
-- Dynamic thread usage - Especially useful for cache starved CPUs like Intels 
   and mobile CPUs. Lifts the performance on the more cache-heavy rotations by
   not using some threads while maintaining the best performance on rotations
   not requiring that much cache.
-- Different prefetch methods - This can bring more performance on CPUs with
   higher overclocks and 2 sticks of RAM while maintaining proper performance
   on CPUs that are underclocked and have 1 stick of RAM.
-- Tune for 2 sub rotations in each rotation to maximize the performance.
- Update algorithms with improvements from JDD cpuminer-opt 3.18.0

#### Flags:
- Add `--url-backup=URL:PORT` - enable backup/failover stratum for the user.
- Add `--log=FILE` - simple log file of the miner output. Useful on Windows.
- Remove `--tune-simple`.
- Add missing `--no-msr` (`-y`) long flag.
- All flags (like `-y` `--tune-full`) are available on all releases but won't 
  do anything if they are not compatible. Should provide better universal 
  usage and script creation.

#### Compilation:
- Fix compilation errors on systems with archaic kernels (CentOS 7, Fedora, Ubuntu).
- Requires c++20 capable compiler. gcc-10 is recommended. gcc-8 minimum.
- Compilation tested on: 
-- CentOS 7, CentOS 8.4
-- Fedora 24, Fedora 28, Fedora 34
-- Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04
- Binaries tested on:
-- CentOS 7 - Requires manual installation of libssl-1.1
-- CentOS 8.4 - OK
-- Fedora 24 - Requires manual installation of libssl-1.1 
-- Fedora 28, 34 - OK
-- Ubuntu 16.04 - Requires manual installation of libssl-1.1
-- Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 - OK


1.1.9

#### Fixes:
- Fix miner stop with `--max-temp` switch.
- Revert some changes so the miner is not so memory sensitive. 1.1.8 could have lower
performance on 1 stick or slower RAM compared to 1.1.7.

#### Changes:
- Include some VAES optimizations for Cryptonight (~1-4% increase).
- Optimizations for Cryptonight implode/explode (~1-2% increase).

#### Added:
- Add `--donation` (`-d`) long flag for use with config files, usefull in HiveOS.

1.1.8

#### Fixes:
- Fix rare cases of Low Difficulty share stream after lost connection.
- Display proper Cryptonight variants used with new blocks.
- Properly calculate real current, min, max, avg hashrate - Hashes done by the miner.
- Block sends of shares with mixed address RTM/WATC/BUTK to the pool.

#### Changes:
- Check for the `--max-temp=N` with every submitted share and ~20s. Previously was ~60s and with new block/job.
- Increase performance of 2 Cryptonight variants and some general Cryptonight changes in GR algo (5-8%). Re-tuning of the miner is recommended!
- Better support for WATC/BUTK mining.
- Provide better info during the tuning process.
- `--benchmark` - Now provides true average hashrate from each rotation and estimated pool average.
- Dev fee changed from 1% to 1.75% with the ability to decrease it back to 1.25% using `-d X` flag.

#### Added:
- `--force-tune` - Forces tuning regardless if the `tune_config` file is present. Useful on HiveOS.
- `--benchmark-old` - Old ratios of calculating hashrate. Left for comparison purposes with the previous version.

#### Removed:
- All algorithms support that is not used by Ghost Rider (GR) algorithm.

#### Notes:
- Ausminers and I have put a great amount of time and work into the miner for this next increase,
so we had to up the dev fee % slightly to 1.75% to help offset that time and allow us to work
on it more in the future. It can still be set with the `-d` parameter back to 1.25%

1.1.7

#### Fixes:
- Fix stratum reconnection problems if users were not able to reconnect within the 60-120s.
- Fix problems with displayed share ping. It could be wrong if some stale shares were skipped. (display only bug)
- Properly detect problems with Large Pages set up on Linux.

#### Improvements:
- Include `tune_config` preset files for many CPU models done with the highest possible tuning options. Thanks again to the community for this amazing contribution.
- Detect multiple NUMA nodes on the system and allocate Large Pages to individual nodes.
- Add additional tuning for AVX2+ instruction sets. Users using those binaries are recommended to retune their miner.
- Default AVX2+ tuning is now extended to 80 minutes. Includes additional tests that should bring more performance (6-18%). Includes options that should benefit most of the CPUs. Use `--tune-simple` for the previous tuning method (34 minutes).
- Stop stratum functionality until miner tunes if tuning is enabled. Should lead to more accurate results.
- `--tune-config=FILE` It will also now specify a non-default (tune_config) file where the tune configuration will be saved.

#### Added:
AVX2+ Only!
- `--tune-full` - 115 minutes. The tuning process tests all possible Cryptonight variants for 4way. Many mobile or low-end CPUs can benefit from it as they are almost always cache starved. It is possible that a longer time from `--tune-full` will not bring any additional performance!
- `--tune-simple` - 54 minutes. Previous tuning with included 4way implementations of Cryptonight Turtle and Turtlelite variants.

#### Build:
- `libnuma` (libnuma-dev) is now required for building the binaries on Linux.

1.1.6

#### Fixes
- Fix dev stratum switch. If dev fee collection is not possible, the dev fee will be skipped.
- Possible fix related to Windows Defender taking an increasing amount of memory if run near the start of the system.

#### Improvements:
- Tuning available on all instruction sets! Now also improves performance in AVX and non-AES versions of the miner.
- Changed default behavior. Now the miner is tuning by default unless the `tune_config` file is present or the `--no-tune` flag is specified.
- `--benchmark` should provide more real-world performance average that users see on pools.
- Detect problems with stratum connection and stop mining threads until the connection can be reestablished. Until now the miner tried to solve and submit shares even the stratum connection was not established. That could lead to sending many old/stale shares to the pool after successful reconnection.
- Disable MSR functionality on non-AES architectures as it leads to a decrease in performance in those cases.
- Tune Cryptonight prefetch and code.

#### Removed:
- `--cn-config=CONFIG`
- `--benchmark-config` 
- `--tune` - This option is now ON by default.

#### Added:
- `--no-tune` - Disable tuning process.

1.1.5.1

- Fix memory leak on Windows.
- Fix problems for users mining BUTK.

1.1.5

- Fixed rare problems with stratum switching that resulted in "low difficulty" shares.
- Minimal tuning for Cryptonight. 1-2% improvement.
- Fixed Windows binaries for 5000 series AMD CPUs. `--tune` and `--tune-config` now work as they should
- `--benchmark` - Proper memory flushing. Should give more accurate results. The current benchmark will report lower values compared to previous versions.

1.1.4

- Fix stratum changes. In specific scenarios, it could produce many errors.
- Bring back some of the lost performance to Ryzens using 1way Cryptonight.
- Reworked some benchmarking functionality to be more representative of real-world hashing. Results are not comparable to previous versions.
- Temporarily restricted tuning of Fast variant of Cryptonight due to reports stating lowered hashrate after tuning on Ryzen 5000 series.

1.1.3

- Dev pool is now selected from the list.
- Show new statistic info about hashrate after each new block.
- Another attempt to fix stratum issues from some users.
- Include prefetch for loading / storing data for Cryptonight (~1-2% improvement)
- Rewrite 2way Cryptonight. (~15-50% improvement)
- Include 2 new options for AVX2+:
  -- `--tune` - Optimal tuning for 2way or 1way solving of Cryptonight. Takes ~34 minutes. Creates `tune_config` file that can be used later. It is recommended to run it with `--benchmark` to disable any stratum and network communication. Can be used directly with your normal mining options and will start mining after the tuning process. After doing it once, use `--tune-config` after that.
  -- `--tune-config=FILE` - Use tuning config generated by `--tune` while mining.

#### The expected improvement compared to 1.1.2 -> 10-30%

1.1.2

- Added automatic Large Pages to the Windows environment. Requires administrator privileges for the one-time setup.
- Added MSR functionality to the Windows environment. Releases will include `WinRing0x64.sys`, licensed and signed Ring0 Driver to enable this functionality.
- Added ability to manually set how Cryptonight algorithms should be solved, SSE or AVX2. --cn-config. Changes algorithm to variants in this order: `Turtlelite, Turtle, Darklite, Dark, Lite, Fast`
presets:
`light`  - equivalent to 0,0,0,0,0,0 (default)
`medium` - equivalent to 0,1,1,1,0,0
`heavy`  - equivalent to 1,1,1,1,1,1
list of 6 coma ',' separated values:
0 - Use SSE2 implementation. 1 - Use AVX2
`--cn-config=medium`
`--cn-config=1,0,0,1,0,0`
- Added a long benchmark of each `--cn-config` configuration. `--benchmark-config` It takes around 20 minutes to complete fully.

1.1.1

- Fixed stratum connection errors.
- Minor improvements to the SSE CN algorithm. Can affect Light/Medium variants.

1.1.0b

- General - Use the latest cpuminer-opt branch.
- MSR ~2-5% increased performance. Enabled by default. Use `-y` to disable it.
-- Linux -- Seamless. Requires `root` privileges.
- Large Pages   ~15-20+% increased performance.
-- Linux -- Seamless. Requires `root` privileges.
-- Windows -- Prior one-time configuration required. Follow this 15s tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows
A system restart is required after successful configuration.
- SSE2 - ~2-3% increase in performance compared to the official miner.
- AVX - ~10-15% increase in performance.
- AVX2 - ~15-25% increase in performance. Multiple binaries. Performance Light -> Heavy depending on the available L3 cache on the CPU. Big CPUs like Zen3, Threadrippers, and Xeons are most likely to benefit from Heavier implementation. 
-- Heavey - All 2way
-- Medium - Mixed SSE & 2way
-- Light - SSE
- Benchmark functionality -- 30s+ benchmark that should give the real average performance of the GR algorithm. Especially useful to test which binaries might be better for your CPU.
- Adjustable Dev Fee -- `-d X` to set donation percentage. Defaults to 1. Can be disabled in the source code.

1.0.0

- Improved hash rate ~2.2X average improvement
- More consistent hash rate (less variation in hash rate)
- Xeon Phi Support (I'm a HPC nerd, so seeing 4KHs+ On a Xeon Phi is awesome. The unoptimized version topped out at 800Hs)
- There is a 1% donation fee built in. (1 min every 100 min)

YMMV due to its inferiour AVX2 implementation.

Fixed Hodl stats, rejects are still an issue since v3.9.5, git issue #237.

API can now be enabled with "-b port" or "--api-bind port".
It will use the default address 127.0.0.1.

Editorial: Short form options should only be used on the command line to save
typing. Configuration files and scripts should always use the long form

block height when solved, job id when stale.

v3.11.5

Fixed AVX512 detection that could cause compilation errors on CPUs
without AVX512.

Fixed "BLOCK SOLVED" log incorrectly displaying "Accepted" when a block

-R, --param-r: set the R parameter for yescrypt or yespower algos, scrypt is
     hardcoded with R=1
-K, --param-key: set the client key/pers parameter for yescrypt/yespower algos.

These options can be used to mine yescrypt or yespower variations using
the generic yescrypt or yespower algo name and specifying the parameters
manually. They can even be used to mine variations that aren't formally
supported by a unique algo name. Existing algos can continue to to be mined
using their original name without parameters.

normal protocol messages. Blue messages (block, stratum, submit) will no
longer be displayed when using -q option.

Lyra2 (all including phi2) now runs optimized code with SSE2.

v3.9.1.1

Fixed lyra2v3 AVX and below.

Compiling on Windows using Cygwin now works. Simply use "./build.sh"
just like on Linux. It isn't portable therefore the binaries package will
continue to use the existing procedure.
The Cygwin procedure will be documented in more detail later and will
include a list of packages that need to be installed.

v3.9.1

Fixed AVX2 version of anime algo.

Added sonoa algo.

Added "-DRYZEN_" compile option for Ryzen to override 4-way hashing when algo 
contains sha256 and use SHA instead. This is due to a combination of
the introduction of HW SHA support combined with the poor performance
of AVX2 on Ryzen. The Windows binaries package replaces cpuminer-avx2-sha
with cpuminer-zen compiled with the override. Refer to the build instructions
for more information.

Ongoing restructuring to streamline the process, reduce latency,
reduce memory usage and unnecessary copying of data. Most of these
will not result in a notoceably higher reported hashrate as the
change simply reduces the time wasted that wasn't factored into the
hash rate reported by the miner. In short, less dead time resulting in
a higher net hashrate.

One of these measures to reduce latency also results in an enhanced
share submission message including the share number*, the CPU thread,
and the vector lane that found the solution. The time difference between
the share submission and acceptance (or rejection) response indicates
network ltatency. One other effect of this change is a reduction in hash
meter messages because the scan function no longer exits when a share is 
found. Scan cycles will go longer and submit multiple shares per cycle.
*the share number is antcipated and includes both accepted and rejected
shares. Because the share is antipated and not synchronized it may be
incorrect in time of very rapid share submission. Under most conditions
it should be easy to match the submission with the corresponding response.

Removed "-DUSE_SPH_SHA" option, all users should have a recent version of
openssl installed: v1.0.2 (Ubuntu 16.04) or better. Ryzen SHA requires
v1.1.0 or better. Ryzen SHA is not used when hashing multi-way parallel.
Ryzen SHA is available in the Windows binaries release package.

Improved compile instructions, now in seperate files: INSTALL_LINUX and
INSTALL_WINDOWS. The Windows instructions are used to build the binaries
release package. It's built on a Linux system either running as a virtual
machine or a seperate computer. At this time there is no known way to
build natively on a Windows system.
